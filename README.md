This is an interpreter for a parody language called: yoloswag

Some keywords in the upcoming version (initial release):

#
	this designates the end of a statement, much like a ; in
	C, C++, Java, etc. The main difference is that by the yoloswag
	convention, the # goes at the beginning of the line, even 
	though it signifies the end of the preceeding statement

yolo
	declares an 8-bit variable
	
swag
	increments a yolo by 1

ratchet
	decrements a yolo by 1

holla
	outputs a character to the console



To be implemented in subsequent versions after release:

(?) gang
	declares an array of yolos

(?) throwback
	jumps to a line number or homie

(?) homie
	gives a specific line number an identifier to be throwback-ed
